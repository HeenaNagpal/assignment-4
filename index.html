    </h1>
    <p>
      The del tag in HTML stands for delete and is used to mark a portion of text which has been deleted from the document.
      The deleted text is rendered as strike-through text by the web browsers although this property can be changed using CSS text-decoration property. 
      The del tag requires a starting and ending tag.</p>

    <h1>
      HTML | The Strong and Emphasis Tags
    </h1>
    <p>
      The strong tag is used when we want to indicate the importance, seriousness, or urgency of a word or section of content without changing 
      the meaning of the content itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content inside is typically displayed in <b>bold</b>.

    </p>
    <p> <strong> <span>Happiness is:</span></strong> When your Code runs without errors.</p>

    <p>
      The em tag places stress emphasis on a particular piece of content in a way that changes the actual meaning of the content. 
      Whenever we want to emphasize something in our markup with verbal stress, we should use em tags.
    </p>
    <p> <strong><span> Happiness is:</span></strong><em>When your Code runs without errors.</em> </p>
